# Exploring First Names and Rankings - 1880-2018

## Introduction
The focus of this project is to utilize data from the U.S. Social Security Adminisration to get some hands on practice using Pandas, Numpy and Bokeh. The data set comes coutesy of the SSA and you can read more about it and access it [here](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/baby-names-from-social-security-card-applications-national-level-data). 

The data is split up into one file per year spanning 1880-2018 and includes the relative frequency of first names for U.S. births over the specified time frame. Each data file includes a list of records in the format of "name,sex,number," with the "number" corresponding to the number of occurences of the name & gender combination for the given year. The data is formatted nicely (sorted by sex, then count), so there isn't really much cleaning to do and there shouldn't be any missing values. 

**The notebook includes some basic analysis to answer questions like:**
1. What are the most popular names of all time - overall and split by gender? And which names are popular for both males and females (i.e., gender neutral)?
2. What's the most popular male and female name for each decade?
3. Which names consistently rank the highest? And how does this compare to overall popularity?
4. Which letters of the alphabet get the most love when it comes to first initials??

Enjoy!
